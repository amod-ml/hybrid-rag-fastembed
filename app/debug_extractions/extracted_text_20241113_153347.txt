INTRODUCTION

The rise in global competition has prompted organizations to devise strategies to have a talented and 
innovative workforce to gain a competitive edge. Developing an internship policy is an impactful 
strategy for creating a future talent pool for the industry. The Internship program not only helps 
fresh pass-outs in gaining professional know-how but also benefits, corporate on fresh perspectives 
on business issues and even discovering future business leaders.

OBJECTIVES

Internships are educational and career development opportunities, providing practical 
experience in a field or discipline. They are structured, short-term, supervised placements often 
focused around particular tasks or projects with defined timescales. An internship may be 
compensated, non-compensated or some time may be paid. The internship has to be meaningful 
and mutually beneficial to the intern and the organization. It is important that the objectives and 
the activities of the internship program are clearly defined and understood. Following are the 
intended objectives of internship training:

• Will expose Technical students to the industrial environment, which cannot be simulated in 
  the classroom and hence creating competent professionals for the industry.

• Provide possible opportunities to learn, understand and sharpen the real time technical / 
  managerial skills required at the job.

• Exposure to the current technological developments relevant to the subject area of training.

• Experience gained from the 'Industrial Internship' in classroom will be used in classroom 
  discussions.

• Create conditions conducive to quest for knowledge and its applicability on the job.

                                                                             Internship Policy                               Page 3
