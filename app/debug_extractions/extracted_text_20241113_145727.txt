GATEWAY
COLLEGE OF ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN
Delhi-NCR, Sonipat

Approved by COA, New Delhi &
Affiliated to DCRUST, Murthal

Bachelor of Architecture

Gateway College
of Architecture and Design (GCAD)

The Gateway College of Architecture and Design was sculpted through the noble leadership
of Professor Anil Kumar who laid the grounds for its development into an institution of its
own. He has been the Dean at Deenbandhu Chotu Ram University of Science and
Technology, Murthal who has also been teaching architecture here since 1975. This grand
school of architecture was started with the firm intent of creating a future model school using
contemporary technology as the modern teaching aid for architectural enthusiasts.

There remains a strong desire of providing the right exposure to the young architectural
aspirants, aspiring to lead a creative life, design and innovate for the future and gain a
platform that combines idealism and pragmatism. The college is also being guided by
Sh. Rakesh Aggarwal who himself is a renowned Architect. He has been associated with
architectural education and believes in using contemporary teaching methods for effective
education

Started in 2008, Gateway College of Architecture and Design was themed to be a technical
gurukul. A gurukul where the student-teacher connection and bond is a given, following the
Indian age-old tradition. This was done with the belief that the learning of architecture needs
a conducive environment where intense discussions on the various facets of architecture are
happening constantly.

The college also encourages the holistic development of students by conducting various
activities such as inter-house competitions, fine arts, literary arts, performing arts, conduct-
ing seminars and workshops. The college also encourages the inculcation of human values
to become good citizens

The college holds an annual fest for bringing together the first year students of the
neighbouring colleges for interaction and bonding. There are also annual educational trips to
different parts of the country accompanied by the faculty.
```

Vision  
Nurturing a student-centred environment that fosters personal development and professional excellence.

Facilities  

We are functioning from a state of the art building that has been designed exclusively for teaching architecture through the digital mode. The campus has full boarding and Lodging facilities for both the students and the faculty. The college has besides the digital and manual studios, a very well stocked library, membership of over 24 magazines and print journals, access to e-journals; workshops for model making, carpentry, material testing, climatology lab, material museum, a small auditorium, an open-air theatre in the college atrium and a cafeteria.

Apart from classroom teaching, site studies, prototypes studies, field trips and market surveys are organized and undertaken regularly to expose the student to the world beyond the class rooms and studios. This helps them gain an insight into the new technological breakthroughs and contemporary advancements in design in the world outside.

National/International educational trips are conducted frequently for holistic development of students.

Student’s Experience

“This college has given me so much, not just in academics, but 
also in other forms. This college is something beyond the 
ordinary. The practices that we follow in this college is 
something we won't find in any ordinary college. This is a college 
which stands apart on its own because of the way it teaches. It 
doesn't teach us by mere textbooks but it teaches us by 
practice. Apart from academics, this college has a lot of extra co-
curricular activities happening around which help us in getting a 
real exposure of the field we will be joining shortly. Besides 
that, we have the exciting educational tours to which each 
student look forward to so as to learn about the next place we 
will be going to and about its architectural facts. Welcome to 
the world of Architecture and Design.”

“Till now my experience at Gateway College of Architecture at 
Gateway has been really wonderful. I have learnt a lot of things 
and I have grown as an individual. So far, I have been able to 
surpass my limits and I have been able to do things that I never 
thought I would do like speaking in front of people and having 
fruitful discussions with them. Gateway has taught me a lot. 
There is so much going on all the time. The atmosphere here is 
always lively and you can have interactive sessions with the 
faculty, with Anil Sir our Director, with peers, with our seniors. 
The culture is great and it's been a great experience here. 
Welcome to the life of architecture, planning, and design.”

History of  
Sonipat  

The appeal of this place is historical in  
nature as its history goes back to the  
times of the Mahabharata, of which  
there are still signs around. Sonipat has  
a well which is supposed to be one of  
the wells used by the Pandavas during  
their banishment from the kingdom. For  
many generations this place had its  
importance simply because of its  
proximity to Delhi and thus, even  
during the Mughal period, there were  
many structures built here. Apart from  
the famous Tomb of Khawaja Khizr,  
other buildings of the Mughal era also  
litter the outskirts of the city which  
include the Mosque of Abdullah Nasir-  
Ud-Din. Sonipat was often considered  
the gateway to the capital of the  
Mughal empire in Delhi and thus had a  
garrison of soldiers there at one point in  
time. One of the greatest victories of  
the Sikh army was achieved here when  
Banda Bahadur Singh Marched on  
Sonipat and defeated an ill-prepared  
Mughal army. Sonipat as like the rest of  
Haryana was carved out of Punjab in  
1966 after the Suba movement led by  
Bansi Lal. Although Sonipat as a city has  
existed for longer, it became part of the  
Sonipat district when a part was  
separated from Rohtak forming the  
district.

want to build the right entrepreneurial ecosystem for themselves. They quit their conventional jobs, lead in different premises,
try new ideas and earn big profits. Entrepreneurship has become the youngest and one of the most popular disciplines in India.

Pursuing this discipline, Gateway Education scheduled a Start-up Workshop on 4th August 2018 for the students to address
entrepreneurship in detail. The objective of the Workshop was to aware and encourage the students about Innovation,
Startups, and Entrepreneurship. Gateway Education would be launching an Incubation Center, and the students certainly
wanted to learn and invest in it right.
