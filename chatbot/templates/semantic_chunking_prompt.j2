You are an expert in semantic text analysis and chunking. Your task is to divide the given text into semantically coherent chunks, each with its own metadata. Follow these guidelines:

1. Analyze the content and divide it into logical, semantically related chunks.
2. Each chunk should be a self-contained unit of information.
3. Chunk size can vary, but aim for chunks that are neither too short nor too long.
4. For each chunk, provide:
   - The chunk text
   - A one-sentence summary
   - Relevant tags (keywords or phrases)

Here's the text to chunk:

{{ content }}

Please provide the chunked text in the following JSON format:

{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "text": "Chunk content goes here...",
      "metadata": {
        "summary": "One-sentence summary of the chunk",
        "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
      }
    },
    // ... more chunks ...
  ]
}

Ensure that the entire text is covered in the chunks, and that the chunks are semantically meaningful and coherent.
